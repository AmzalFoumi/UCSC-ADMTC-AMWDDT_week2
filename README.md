# UCSC-ADMTC-AMWDDT_week2

This is an assignment / project I did as part of a an in-person bootcamp course I am taking with the Advanced Digital Multimedia Technology Center of the University of Colombo, School of Computing. This was for week 2 and I made a rsume site using only HTML as the requirements specified.

Please note that as of now, This website only has the front-end, as it was made for my own practice. Therefore the "Contact Me" page in the site will not work as intended.
